### <i> Advanced Music Database REST API </i>

##  About The Project
Songify is a scalable RESTful API designed for managing a music database (Songs, Albums, Artists, and Genres).

The core CRUD operations are implemented with a strong emphasis on Clean Code principles, SOLID architecture, and REST API best practices, ensuring high maintainability and readability.
<br>**Furthermore, the primary focus of this project is a highly secure Hybrid Authentication System**. It combines traditional manual registration with Google OAuth2 Login, unified under a custom RSA-signed JWT architecture.

##  Tech Stack & Tools

**Backend Core:**
*   **Java 17** & **Spring Boot 3** (Core framework)
*   **Spring Security & OAuth2 + JWT** (Authentication & Authorization)
*   **PostgreSQL** (Relational database)
*   **Flyway** (Database migration and versioning)
*   **MapStruct** (Efficient Entity-to-DTO mapping)

**Testing:**
*   **JUnit 5** (Testing framework)
*   **Mockito** (Mocking framework for unit tests)
*   **AssertJ** (Fluent assertions)

**DevOps & Integrations:**
*   **Docker & Docker Compose** (Containerization)
*   **Swagger / OpenAPI** (API documentation & interactive testing)
*   **JavaMailSender** (Email confirmation flow)

## Key Features
* **Advanced Hybrid Security Architecture:**
    * **Unified Token System:** Both traditional login and Google OAuth2 result in a custom, self-signed RSA-256 JWT.
    * **Stateless Sessions:** Fully stateless architecture utilizing `HttpOnly` and `Secure` cookies to prevent XSS attacks. No tokens are exposed in the Local Storage.
    * **Auto-Registration:** Users logging in via Google for the first time are automatically registered in the database.
    * **Email Verification:** Manual registration requires account activation via an email confirmation link.
* **Complex Data Relations:** Managed Many-to-Many and One-to-Many relationships between Artists, Albums, and Songs using Hibernate/JPA.
* **Interactive API Documentation:** Beautifully integrated Swagger UI / OpenAPI 3.0.
* **Fully Containerized:** The entire application, including the PostgreSQL database, is fully containerized using a multi-stage Docker build and Docker Compose.

###  Security Flow Highlights
As a junior developer, I wanted to go beyond standard Basic Auth. Here is how the security flows in this application:
1. **OAuth2 Flow:** When a user logs in via Google, the application intercepts the Google Token, verifies the user, and discards the Google Token.
2. **Custom JWT Generation:** The backend then generates its own custom JWT signed with a private RSA key.
3. **Cookie Delivery:** This JWT is embedded into an `HttpOnly`, `Secure` cookie and sent to the browser.
4. **Custom Filter:** Every subsequent request is intercepted by a custom `JwtAuthTokenFilter` that extracts the cookie, validates the RSA signature using the public key, and sets the Spring `SecurityContext`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
* *(No local Java or Maven installation is required to run the project, as it uses a multi-stage Docker build).*

### Installation & Running
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tejszerska/songify
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd songify
```

Build and start the entire ecosystem (App + Database) using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```
### API Documentation
Once the application is running, you can interact with the API and test the authentication flows using the Swagger UI:

URL: https://localhost:8443/swagger-ui/index.html
<br>**(Note: requires accepting the self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS).**

##  Important Note on Environment Variables & Security

For security reasons, sensitive credentials (such as Google OAuth2 Client Secrets and Gmail SMTP passwords) are strictly excluded from this repository and ignored via `.gitignore`.
* The application will still successfully boot up using fallback dummy values. 
* Core CRUD operations and traditional manual JWT authentication will work perfectly with example user credentials
 ```bash
 {
  "username": "a@dmin",
  "password": "123"
  }
   ```
at endpoint
 ```bash
 POST /intentity/token
   ```

Since the JWT token is automatically stored in a secure cookie upon login, you don't need to manually copy and paste it anywhere. Just log in and start testing the endpoints right away!

### How to run the app with your own credentials:
If you want to test the full flow (including Google Login and Email Verification), follow these steps before running Docker:

1. Locate the `.env.example` file in the root directory.
2. Create a copy of this file and rename it to exactly `.env`.
3. Fill in the `.env` file with your actual credentials:
   ```bash
   MAIL_SENDER_PWD=your_16_character_google_app_password
   OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth2_client_id
   OAUTH2_SECRET=your_google_oauth2_client_secret

<br><br> (Note: requires accepting the self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS).
